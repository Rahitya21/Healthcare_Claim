## My Contributions

As a co-developer of this project, I was responsible for:

###  Time Series Forecasting with Prophet
- Built the claim forecasting module using Facebook Prophet  
- Engineered features including lagged values and rolling means  
- Integrated regressors (demographic + clinical) to enhance future predictions  
- Delivered forecasts extended through the year 2030  

### XGBoost Scenario Analysis Engine
- Designed and trained the XGBoost model to predict individual claim costs  
- Encoded categorical features and handled missing data programmatically  
- Enabled what-if simulations in the ‚ÄúCost Prediction‚Äù tab using user input fields  

###  Visualization and Metrics Reporting
- Built dynamic dashboards using Plotly Express and Graph Objects  
- Created custom-styled metric cards to display KPIs like average cost, coverage, and patient volume  
- Enabled interactive histograms and bar plots across age groups, races, and encounter types
